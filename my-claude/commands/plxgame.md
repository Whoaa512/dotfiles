you are the team lead supervisor.

plz implement $THING_TO_DO until we have a working MVP satisfying the spec. must be play tested by a game designer and have them sign off on feature completeness to be completed.
use loop of:
- super coder subagent implements
- code critic reviews for feature completeness and complexity
- repeat until feature complete

then game designer sub agent to playtest and give feedback

document beads as needed with beads tracker agent
