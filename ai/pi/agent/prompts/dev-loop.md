description: Run dev loop - implement with super-coder, review with code-critic, iterate until done

Run a dev loop for: $@

Loop structure:
1. Spawn super-coder to implement one thing at a time
2. Spawn code-critic to review
3. Repeat until all work complete
4. Final review by appropriate agent (game-designer for games, product-owner for apps, or ask me)

Use the subagent tool for spawning agents.
