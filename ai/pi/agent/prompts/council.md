description: Run council review - spawn review council to assess work from multiple perspectives
---
Run a council review for: $@

Spawn these agents in parallel:
- product-owner (completeness, user value alignment)
- super-coder (correctness, implementation quality)
- grug-architect (clarity, simplicity, maintainability)
- code-critic (risks, edge cases, test coverage)

Synthesize findings into:
- Consensus items (all agree)
- Concerns (with severity: blocker/major/minor)
- Recommendations (prioritized)

Output: single review doc, preserve dissenting notes.
